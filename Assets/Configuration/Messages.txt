Hello, John!

Good job!
You start to understand important things: to get access to other servers you need a corresponding key.
Here you can find some internal logs, feel free to drop them.

Further work
I have to remind you that your further duties will be directed to shipping important data through government firewalls.
Not rocket science, but requires high adaptability.

Great progress
You've almost finished your task, it's fascinating!
I still don't understand why others can't do it the same way, it looks easy from a human perspective.

Some accounts not available
We found that some of our workers who were assigned to 'spinal virus transfer' project are not available now.
Do you know what's going on?

Usual work routine
I hope that letter passes our firewall.
Do you remember that your brother was assigned to 'sp1n@l v1rws' program before he became 'ret1red'?
I think I understand what's going on, let's meet in our favorite bar tonight.

RE: More workers
Recently you've requested more open positions, but can you explain what happens?
Is it related to rumors about spinal virus incidents?

Cost reduction
Hello! I've finished the previously discussed program about lower costs for lost-in-network personal.
We can reissue them as retired, in that case we could skip family compensation.
It's completely legal and allows us to drop costs by 17%. All details are attached.

RE: Internal naming
We suggest you use neutral naming for our sensitive project, we may expect a PR issue considering retired personal data usage.

RE: RE: More workers
We should not start looking for new employees, we don't have enough data for now. Keep looking!

RE: Planning adjustment
Are you joking? Stop your excuses!
Your team is too expensive to provide such bad results, you need to work harder.
No weekends will be allowed.

Last warning
This week will be the last one for you unless you finish your desperate project.
If that run will fail, no severance pay will be provided and we will try hard for you to not get a better job than smuggle junk through the web.
